A detailed description of the project can be found in the presentation attached to the repository.
This project is part of a larger team project (constituting a data science bootcamp assignment), the final product of which will be a simple application indicating, based on medical examination results, the probability of developing coronary artery disease. Additionally, this application is intended to provide the client with detailed information about coronary artery disease, preventive measures, and suggest further medical steps related to the diagnosis based on the model (depending on which factors have the greatest impact on the risk of developing the disease).
Team members: Marcin Szumniak, Marcin Roszak, SÅ‚awomir Grzebyk, and Piotr Miernik
